# Todo List App
 A simple to-do list application written in the Python programming language using the Streamlit library.
 
# What I Learned?
- Defined functions which appends a new to-do item to the existing list of to-dos, and then writes the updated list of to-dos back to the file.
- Sets the title and subheader of the app and displays the to-do items in a checkbox format, allowing the user to check off completed items. An option is also given to add new to-do items.
