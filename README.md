# My Todo App
A simple to-do list application built using Streamlit.

# Requirements
- streamlit
- function (a custom module)

# How it works
The app starts by importing the streamlit and function modules. The function.get_todos() is used to retrieve the existing to-do items from the function module.

The add_todo function is defined to handle the addition of new to-do items. The new to-do item is appended to the todos list and saved using the function.write_todos() method.

The app displays a title and subheader and a description to increase productivity. The existing to-do items are displayed as checkboxes. The user can check the box to mark an item as complete and remove it from the list. The new to-do items can be added using a text input field. The app uses Streamlit session state to store and retrieve data.

The final output is a web-based to-do list application that allows the user to add, view, and remove to-do items.
